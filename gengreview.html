    <h1> My Opinion on Generation Girl </h1>
<div>
    <p> Ever since the first week, I've been impressed with how <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> coordinated </span> everything is , I learned about <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Computer Science  </span>, though it is an unfamiliar topic, I find myself being amused at how the mentors give <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">brief yet clear explanation</span>!</p>
    <p>On the second week, I learned about<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> Game Design</span>! it was super fun and the atmosphere weas really light and friendly! I even made my own FlappyBird! q(≧▽≦q)</p>
